Put down that phone and listen
Baby, how can you be so unkind?
If they catch me out of line only one more time
I'll be down in the slammer 'fore you count to nine

I didn't mean to step out without you
And I'm sorry way down in my soul
But you know it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby

Before they throw me in the hole
I got to get my dose of Rock and Roll
And it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby, baby let go

Put down that gun and listen
If you shoot it would be such a waste
'Cause any one of these days, I just might change my ways
And I won't be around to see the look on your face

I know that it might make you happy
To fill my body full of holes
But you know it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby

Before they throw me in the hole
I got to get my dose of Rock and Roll
And it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby, baby let go

Put down the phone and put down the gun
Please let me know you still believe in me, hon
Put down the phone and put down the gun
Please let me know you still believe in me, honey

Put down the phone and put down the gun
Please let me know you still believe in me, honey
Put down the phone and put down the gun
Please let me know you still believe in me, hon

I didn't mean to step out without you
And I'm sorry way down in my soul
But you know it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby

Before they come to get my soul
I got to get my dose of Rock and Roll
And I'd do anything to get off on

Parole with you baby, baby, let go

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
